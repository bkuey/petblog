    <h1>My Dog Rocky</h1>

      <p>Rocky was my first and only family dog that we ever had. We got him
      when we was a puppy and he was the most energetic dog I've ever met. We
      had him for about 5 years and we had to give him away because we were
      moving and it was my biggest heartbreak. I hope he continued to live a
      wonderful dog life.</p>

      <p>Here are some of the things he liked to do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Chase and Race</li>
          <li>Cuddle</li>
          <li>Hurdle over rocks</li>
          <li>Follow me around</li>
        </ul>
